# üí∏ Payment Program

The **Payment Program** can schedule one-time and recurring token transfers on Solana. It uses [token delegation](https://spl.solana.com/token#authority-delegation) and a [bounty system](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounty_(reward)#Mathematics>) to schedule [token transfers](https://spl.solana.com/token#transferring-tokens) on a signer's behalf.

The Payment Program offers two optimizations over existing web3 "payments streaming" protocols:

1. Capital efficiency ‚Äì The sender can hold onto their tokens right up until the moment they're sent. The Payment Program does not lockup future payments in a vesting contract. This is ideal for use-cases like payroll and consumer subscription payments.

2. Time efficiency ‚Äì The recipient has tokens deposited directly to their wallet. The Payment Program does not force recipients to "claim" their received payments from a vesting contract. This is ideal for use-cases like streaming yield or royalties.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

TODO write this section

## üëâ Getting Started

### Integrate and build

To integrate with the Payment Program, add it to your dependencies (see [**CPI Examples**](https://github.com/faktorfi/indexor#cpi-examples) for sample code snippets):

```yaml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
streamor = { version = "0.1.0", features = ["cpi"] }
```

### Hack around

To download and play with the code, clone the repo:

```sh
# Terminal

git clone git@github.com:faktorfi/programs.git
cd programs
yarn
anchor build
anchor test
```

### Submit an improvement

If you spot a bug or want to submit a improvement, join the [Faktor Discord](https://discord.gg/EdsWFHczfy) and come say hello! We're a group of people building [public key infrastructure (PKI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure) and [payments systems](https://faktor.finance) on Solana.

## ü¶Ä CPI Examples

The code snippets in this section are for Solana programs that need to schedule and manage on-chain payments. These examples assume the program has a singleton "program authority account" for signing instructions on behalf of the program.

### Creating an payment

This example instruction `create_my_payment` displays a program creating a one-time payment. Since the program signs the `create_payment` instruction with its authority account (a [PDA](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs#program-derived-addresses)), Streamor marks the authority as the payment's owner ‚Äì guaranteeing only the program authority may update it.

```rs
// create_my_payment.rs

use {
    crate::state::*,
    anchor_lang::{prelude::*, solana_program::system_program},
    payment_program::{
        cpi::{accounts::CreatePayment, create_payment},
        program::payment_program,
        state::Payment,
    },
};

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(bump: u8)]
pub struct CreateMyPayment<'info> {
    #[account(mut, seeds = [SEED_AUTHORITY], bump = authority.bump)]
    pub authority: Account<'info, Authority>,

    #[account(mut)]
    pub payment: Account<'info, Payment>,

    #[account(address = payment_program::ID)]
    pub payment_program: Program<'info, PaymentProgram>,

    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(address = system_program::ID)]
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

pub fn handler(ctx: Context<CreateMyIndex>, bump: u8) -> ProgramResult {
    // Get accounts.
    let authority = &ctx.accounts.authority;
    let payment = &ctx.accounts.payment;
    let system_program = &ctx.accounts.system_program;

    // TODO Create my payment.
}
```
